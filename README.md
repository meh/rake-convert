rake-convert - Convert Rakefiles to Makefile/configure
======================================================

This is a simple rake plugin that converts the Rakefile to a Makefile and mkmf stuff into a
configure script.

Useful to have a flexible building system like Rake while maintaining no dependencies to build.

Look at https://github.com/meh/craftd to see an example of a convertable Rakefile.
